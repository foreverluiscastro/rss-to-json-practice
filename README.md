# Using the rss-to-json NPM package

I wanted to display my Medium blogs on my website to create a better user experience. I originally tried using the Medium API but found out the API was made for write only purposes. So, to grab the information related with my stories, I used the stories RSS feed: https://medium.com/feed/@your-user-name-here and then used the rss-to-json package to parse the rss into stringied json, and then take that string and parse it into sweet sweet json.
